# Project Name

This project is a **real-time data management tool** developed using modern technologies and best practices to ensure clean, maintainable, and efficient code. The project aims to **provide an efficient way to manage and interact with data in real-time, with features such as dynamic formatting, cell management, and real-time updates**. This tool allows users to make changes to a virtual spreadsheet-like environment with a responsive interface and various formatting options.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (if applicable)
- **Database**: MongoDB (if applicable)
- **Other Tools**: Quill.js (for text editing and rich formatting)

## Data Structures Used
- **State Management**: The state of the application is managed using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing UI updates based on user interactions.
- **Quill.js Data Structure**: For handling rich text and real-time data formatting, Quill.js is used. It allows the user to edit and format text, and we track styles like bold, italic, font-size, etc., in a structured way.
- **Arrays/Objects**: Arrays are used to store lists of active elements, like cells, or search results. Objects represent the structure of a cell and its corresponding attributes like formatting, color, etc.

## Why These Technologies?
- **React**: Chosen for its flexibility, component-based structure, and efficient rendering, which is essential for building interactive UI components such as the toolbar, text editors, and input fields.
- **Chakra UI**: Provides a set of pre-built accessible components, which speeds up the development and ensures a responsive layout across devices.
- **Quill.js**: Ideal for text-editing functionality, allowing for rich text formatting like bold, italics, underline, etc., with full customization options.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Makes it easier to build custom layouts without writing extensive CSS, enabling a faster development process with utility-first design principles.

## How It Works
1. **Real-time Data Formatting**: Users can interact with cells in a dynamic sheet and format text by selecting options from the toolbar (e.g., bold, italic, text color).
2. **Zoom and Font Size Adjustment**: The toolbar allows users to zoom in and out of the sheet, as well as adjust font size for better readability.
3. **Color Picker for Background and Text**: Custom color pickers allow users to change the background and text color within cells.
4. **Search Functionality**: A built-in search bar lets users quickly find data within the sheet, with navigation for moving between search results.
